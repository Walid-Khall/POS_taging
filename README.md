# Parts-of-Speech Tagging (POS)

Parts-of-Speech Tagging (POS)
This exercise will develop skills in part-of-speech (POS) tagging, the process of assigning a part-of-speech tag (Noun, Verb, Adjective...) to each word in an input text. Tagging is difficult because some words can represent more than one part of speech at different times. They are Ambiguous. Let's look at the following example:

The whole team played well. [adverb]
You are doing well for yourself. [adjective]
Well, this assignment took me forever to complete. [interjection]
The well is dry. [noun]
Tears were beginning to well in her eyes. [verb]
Distinguishing the parts-of-speech of a word in a sentence will help you better understand the meaning of a sentence. This would be critically important in search queries. Identifying the proper noun, the organization, the stock symbol, or anything similar would greatly improve everything ranging from speech recognition to search. By completing this assignment, you will:

Learn how parts-of-speech tagging works
Compute the transition matrix A in a Hidden Markov Model
Compute the emission matrix B in a Hidden Markov Model
Compute the Viterbi algorithm
Compute the accuracy of your own model
